                    <p>The selection of the parts you wish to buy to build your Gaming PC is crucial, in terms of compatability and suitability to task. The cost of can vary depending on the FPS, quality of resolution, and graphics you wish to achieve for the videogames you want to play. Down below is a list that you can start:</p>
                    <h3>Your PC Case</h3>
                    <p>The PC case is the very foundation of your whole PC build. A large case for hard-drives, graphics cards, motherboards, cooling system is essential to maximize the quality of your build. Every PC case lists the motherboard formats it supports. Here are 3 main layouts you need to know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>ATX (a full-size, mainstream motherboard)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>MicroATX (a smaller variant with fewer expansion slots and other surface-area-related features)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Mini-ITX (even smaller, usually offering just a single slot for a video card)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                    <h3>The Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>There are many motherboards available in the market. However, you would need to choose the perfect one for you, depending on these 3 factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>A motherboard that works with the CPU you want to select.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The motherboard should come in the right size and format to your PC case.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There should be external ports and internal slots in order to add additional components.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The CPU and its Cooler</h3>
                    <p>The CPUs must work together with the motherboard to provide you the best performance. There are two relevant CPU manufacturers that can provide you quality performance - (a) Intel, (b) AMD Ryzen. It is your choice depending on the affordability and performance you wish to achieve.</p>
                    <p>A cooler's task is to ensure that the temperature does not exceed as CPUs tend to become hot. A liquid cooling system or fans can help mitigate the heat. If you do not want to overclock your CPU however, it is advisable to select a liquid cooling system.</p>

                    <h3>The Storage: SSDS and Hard-drives</h3>
                    <p>There is wide variety of SSDs available, but the default with new motherboards is a solid-state boot drive in an M.2 format supporting PCI Express data transfers. Stick-of-gum-sized M.2 drives save space inside your PC case, improving cable management, and provide access to the high-speed PCI Express (abbreviated PCIe) bus. PCI Express 4.0 drives have emerged as the high-end performance standard these days.</p>

                    <h3>Get Your Tools</h3>
                    <code class="code-1">It is best to find a multi kit with an assortment or small and large screwdrivers. You may also need a grounding strap to avoid electrocution. As well, always avoid liquids near electronics.</code>

                    <h3>How to install the CPU and Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>Whether LGA or PGA, be exceedingly careful with both motherboard and processor and double that caution wherever the pins are involved. On one side of the motherboard's CPU socket, you'll see a load lever held in place by spring tension. A black plastic protective square covers the socket. Depress and pull aside the load lever and let it rise, releasing the retention frame over the CPU socket.</p>
                    <p>With the arrows lined up, these notches should align with nibs in the socket that will engage them. Lower the CPU into the socket parallel to the board. Alternately, you can line up the bottom edge and lower the chip from a 45-degree angle down to flat, but don't depress or mash the pins in any way. The CPU should fit in place perfectly without any force—if you have to push, you're doing it wrong. If the CPU seems off-kilter or not perfectly flat, gently remove it and try again, checking that you got the orientation right.</p>
                    <p>Assuming your processor is lying flat and all looks well, give the CPU the gentlest of left-to-right wiggles to ensure it's perfectly seated. The chip should not budge a millimeter. Once you're confident the CPU is properly seated, you'll want to snap the plastic cover off the retaining frame. The plastic typically hooks to the frame and takes a little working or wiggling to get it off.</p>
                    <code>Verify the manuals of all components before installation.</code>

                    <h3>How to install the memory</h3>
                    <p>Look closely at your DDR4 modules. You'll see a notch on the edge of the contacts. Match that notch with the keying inside the motherboard memory slots; the DIMMs will install only one way. Before you install them, however, check your motherboard manual to see the optimal installation arrangement given the number of modules you have.</p>
                    <p>The DIMM sockets on the motherboard will have a lever either at one end or on both ends. Lower one or both levers on the slots you'll use.</p>
                    <code>Always verify if the memory matches the motherboard requirements.</code>

                    <h3>How to install the M.2 SSD</h3>
                    <p>Once you've determined the slot to use, you'll find it may be open or covered with a heatsink or heat spreader. The latter may look like part of the board decor that you'll need to unscrew and remove. The SSD may have a heat spreader of its own, in the form of a thin surface strip or a larger superstructure with its own heatsink. The latest SSDs tend to run hot, so you want to pay special attention here. We suggest using the motherboard-integrated heat spreader unless the drive you buy comes with a more robust one installed. If it has a graphene or other thin heat strip on it, you can leave that in place under a motherboard-provided heat spreader like ours.</p>
                    <p>One thing to note before you install the SSD and any heatsink cover: If there is a thermal pad below it on the motherboard, peel off any plastic protector before installing the drive. (The pad is usually a little bit sticky.) Likewise, on the underside of the heatsink cover that's part of the motherboard, there will usually be a pad with a plastic strip covering it. Peel it off before reinstalling the heatsink cover.</p>
                    <code>It is <span>necessary</span> to slowly install your SSD cards.</code>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Mount the motherboard</h3>
                    <p>Assuming your case is a typical midtower like ours, remove both of its side panels. With this case, you remove two thumbscrews on each panel and pop off the sides with your thumbs.</p>
                    <p>Look at your motherboard and match the pattern of holes on the board to the standoffs or standoff holes in the motherboard tray. If no standoffs are preinstalled, you'll need to install them in the same pattern in the case as on your motherboard. If standoffs are preinstalled, you need to make sure one is installed for each hole in the board and (this is important!) that no standoffs are installed where there isn't a matching hole in the motherboard.</p>
                    <p>For an ATX board, you're looking at eight or nine holes; a MicroATX platform may have seven or eight, and Mini-ITX will have fewer. If you need to remove any standoffs that are preinstalled, use pliers. Some PC cases come with a hexagonal Phillips screwdriver bit in the accessory box to help you install or remove standoffs.</p>
                    <p>Grab your magnetic screwdriver, a proper Phillips bit, and motherboard screws from the case kit and begin screwing the board into place. Start with the centermost screw, which will help the others line up, then do the far corners. (Sometimes the centermost screw position is actually a peg, which makes things easier.) Once you get the first few screws in, the rest should be easy. If the screws don't catch but simply rotate, you're using the wrong ones.</p>
                    <code>It is <span>necessary</span> to always clean your surfaces and to wear gloves.</code>

                    <p>One immediate tweak you can make here is to set the memory speed via an XMP (Intel) or Expo (AMD) profile. You'll want to activate one or the other and choose one of the preset memory profiles that corresponds to what your RAM kit supports. Note that Expo in its early days has been connected to some overheating scenarios with certain CPUs; before activating Expo, be sure your motherboard BIOS has been updated to the latest version recommended on the board maker's site.</p>
                    <code>Once you've created the Windows install media, plug the USB drive into one of the ports in the back of the system and reboot. if the system just goes back to the BIOS, you may need to enable USB boot in the BIOS and or set the boot order to prioritize the USB key.</code>
